In the method calculateTFerma() {
  * Initialize the variable checkSum for further comparison.
  * Initialize the variable n with a value of 2. It will be our degree.
  * Created three cycle:
    - The first cycle serves us to further verify the amount.
    - The second and third cycle for running numbers with degree two, 
      which in the sum of two values will give us less than 100.
  * The equation.
  * Check that there is a natural solution from 1 to 100 with a degree of n = 2.
  * Output values.
  
  **:-Conclusion-:->** If we assign a value n to a number greater than n > 2. 
                       That program does not display anything to us. 
                       This proves to us that there are no natural solutions from 1 to 100 n> 2.

}

In the method calcExpression() {
  * We initialize the variable for output, the same variable for evaluating the expression.
  * Cycle to handle 10,000 values.
  * Check if an even number then a negative sign else. Otherwise a positive sign.
  * Output values.
  
  **:-Conclusion-:->**  A cycle with branching operators, 
                       for an even number we have a difference of values, 
                       for an odd value we have an addition. Values distributed by cycle.
